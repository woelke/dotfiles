Introduction
============
This is my Dotfile project. I store these files on Github just for myself, but of course I do not forbid to use it or snatch ideas from it.

My Dotfiles contain a quite complex vim configuration, my favorite Linux programmes, a few helper scripts, and a simple zsh configuration.


Requirements
============
    
    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ bb-parser-woelke


Startup
=======
Run the following commands to configure all automatically:

    git clone https://github.com/aufgang001/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./bootstrap.sh
